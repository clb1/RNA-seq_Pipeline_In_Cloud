## RNA-seq pipeline in the Google cloud
Only large Compute clusters or the cloud have the computational resources needed to collate and analyze the majority of the worldwide transcriptome sequencing data (RNA-seq). The Makefile and scripts included herein are a framework enabling automatic data tranfers and pipeline stage execution for tens of thousands of data sets and an arbitrary number of computational stages.
